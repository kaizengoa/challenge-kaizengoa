/**
 * First-touch attribution, captured once and remembered.
 *
 * The problem this solves: `readUtm()` reads the CURRENT url. On /checkout
 * that url has no query string, because the buyer navigated there from the
 * landing page by clicking a link. So every UTM, the fbclid and the referrer
 * — the entire answer to "which ad produced this sale" — evaporates one click
 * after arrival, and the order is written with blank campaign fields.
 *
 * So the campaign context is stamped into localStorage on FIRST landing, on
 * whichever page that happens to be, and read back at checkout.
 *
 * Overwrite rule: a visit carrying a utm_source or an fbclid is a new ad
 * click and replaces what is stored — last paid click wins, which is what the
 * ad account is judged on. A visit with neither (a direct return, a bookmark,
 * an organic search) leaves the stored campaign alone rather than blanking it,
 * which is the failure mode that makes paid sales look organic.
