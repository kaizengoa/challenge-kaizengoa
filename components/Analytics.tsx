/**
 * The GA4 base tag and the Microsoft Clarity tag, both driven by env rather
 * than pasted into the layout by hand.
 *
 * This exists because every GA4 call in lib/ga4.ts checks for `window.gtag`
 * and returns quietly when it is absent. Without a base tag on the page, that
 * check never passes: view_item, add_to_cart and generate_lead all silently
 * do nothing, and the failure looks exactly like a working site.
 *
 * Both tags render nothing when their id is missing, so an unfilled env var
 * leaves no broken script tag behind.
 *
 * afterInteractive, not beforeInteractive: neither tag is needed for first
 * paint, and the first event this page fires (view_item) is dispatched from
 * FunnelTracker's effect, which runs after hydration.
 *
 * The Clarity Script id is "ms-clarity" and must never be "clarity". Any
 * element with an id becomes a named global, so id="clarity" makes
 * window.clarity an HTMLScriptElement before the snippet below runs. The
 * snippet's `c[a] = c[a] || function(){...}` then sees a truthy value, skips
 * creating the queue stub, and the tag from clarity.ms dies on
 * "a[c] is not a function". The tag loads, the project is valid, and the
 * dashboard stays empty, with the only trace a single console error.
