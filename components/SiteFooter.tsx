/**
 * One footer for every page: landing, legal and thank-you.
 *
 * Ankita runs two different footers, a dark one on the landing page and a
 * light ruled strip on the checkout, which means the disclaimer only appears
 * on some pages. Here it is a single dark component so the legal text and the
 * policy links are present wherever someone lands, including on a checkout
 * they reached from an ad.
 *
 * `children` is an optional slot above the disclaimer for page-specific detail
 * (the landing page puts its brand mark and cohort dates there). Everything
 * below that slot is identical on all three pages, by design.
 *
 * The disclaimer text is the CLIENT'S OWN WORDING, moved here from the framed
 * box that used to sit above the footer on the landing page. It is legal copy:
 * do not reword it, and do not let it drift between pages, which is the whole
 * reason it lives in one component.
