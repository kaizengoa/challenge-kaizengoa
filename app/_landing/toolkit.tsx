/**
 * Section 8 · the toolkit.
 *
 * Six things that sum to a price, so the shape is accumulation. Two rules
 * decide the treatment:
 *
 *  1. The value is shown PER ITEM, never as one lump "worth ₹5,485" — a lump
 *     is a claim, a line-item is a contract.
 *  2. The challenge itself is the item that dominates (₹2,500 of the ₹5,485
 *     and the only LIVE one), so it is lifted out of the grid and given the
 *     lead card. The layout says which one matters before the copy does.
 *
 * This is the FIRST of the page's two accumulation beats. The second is the
 * closing recap, which is a ruled ledger — the two are deliberately different
 * forms so the recap reads as a summing-up rather than as a repeat.
 *
 * No cover art exists for the guides, so these are typographic cards carrying
 * an ordinal and a value rather than mock-up shots. When covers land they slot
 * in above each title.

/* ⚠️ THIS COVER MUST AGREE WITH below-fold.tsx DAYS. It is the one asset on the
   page that spells out the schedule in pixels, which means the copy has no way
   to correct it if it drifts — and it has drifted twice already.

   The original, /images/challenge-days.png, read "Mat Pilates and Mobility ·
   Gentle Yoga and Breathwork · Mindfulness and Sound Healing · Face Yoga and
   De-Puffing · Nutrition and Integration". Face yoga and the nutrition day are
   not part of this challenge and never were, so it was pulled (spec PRIORITY 2)
   and the slot ran empty.

   The first replacement supplied as included_01.png was the PRE-CORRECTION
   running order: it opened on Mat Pilates, put Hatha Yoga second and still
   carried a "Yoga Nidra +" day that PRIORITY 1 had removed. Only two of its
   five cards matched the page. It was rejected and re-cut.

   The file here now is the corrected one and matches DAYS exactly, day number
   for day number. If the cohort's running order ever changes again, this image
   changes WITH it or comes down — a picture that contradicts the schedule three
   screens below it is worse than no picture, because the reader cannot tell
   which one they are buying.

   ⚠️ FILENAME CASING: lowercase "included_01.png", unlike the capital-G
   "Guide_06.png"/"Guide_07.png" beside it. Windows resolves paths
   case-insensitively and Vercel does not, so a mis-cased reference works on a
   dev machine and 404s only in production. Copy names off disk. */

  /* ── The two added by spec PRIORITY 4 ─────────────────────────────────────
     Both ran with a reserved placeholder slot until Kaizen supplied the covers.
     They now carry real art like the other four.

     ⚠️ THE FILENAMES ARE CAPITAL-G UNDERSCORE — "Guide_06.png", not
     "guide-06.png". They do not follow the lowercase-hyphen convention the
     other four covers use, and that matters more than it looks: Windows treats
     paths case-insensitively, so a mis-cased reference works perfectly on a dev
     machine and then 404s on Vercel, whose filesystem is case-sensitive. Copy
     the name off disk exactly rather than typing it to match the neighbours.

     Both mockups are 2400x1792 (4:3) with the book centred and wide background
     margins on either side, while the other four covers are square. They are
     rendered in the same 1:1 slot anyway: a centre crop of a 4:3 frame keeps
     the middle ~75% of the width, which is comfortably wider than the book, so
     only empty background is lost. Six cards of equal shape beats two odd ones
     out. If art ever arrives where the book fills the frame, give those two
     ratio="4 / 3" instead — see the note on Art in shared.tsx.

     Note on the stack as a whole: the spec's wording ("replace bonus item 02
     and add a fifth item") and its stated total of ₹6,788 could not both be
     satisfied — dropping the ₹997 playbook lands the stack at ₹5,294. Atul
     confirmed the TOTAL is the binding figure, so nothing was removed and both
     new items were added. 2500 + 997 + 497 + 497 + 497 + 900 + 900 = 6,788. */
