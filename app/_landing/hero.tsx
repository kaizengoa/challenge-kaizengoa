/* ══ 0 · Announcement strip (R10) ══════════════════════════════════════════
   A slim navy strip with one live coral dot and a slow shine, so it reads as
   alive rather than as a static red sale bar. It names a specific price, a
   specific anchor and a specific number — never "limited time".

   The old second segment read "Price Increases To ₹1599 Tomorrow" and had done
   so, unchanged, for several weeks while the price stayed at ₹497. A deadline
   that never arrives does not just stop working; it teaches the reader to
   discount every other claim on the page, including the ones that are true.

   It is now the seat cap — spec BLOCKER 2, option B, taken because no dated
   instruction arrived by Sunday 21 Sept. ⚠️ SEATS_LEFT is a real number that
   someone has to keep current (see offer.ts). A stale seat count is the same
   broken promise wearing different clothes. */

 *
 * The system-stack graphic, restored at Atul's request. It replaced a
 * credential card (spec PRIORITY 3) that was built in HTML and CSS from the
 * supplied portrait; that version is in git history if it is ever wanted back.
 *
 * The first version of this asset named five days that were not the five days
 * being run — it still carried "Face Yoga & De-Puffing" and "Nutrition &
 * Integration", which spec PRIORITY 2 existed to remove. The file here now is
 * the re-cut, and its cards match DAYS in below-fold.tsx exactly: Sleep Reset
 * with Prerna, Mat Pilates for Pain & Stiffness, Mat Pilates for Strength &
 * Mobility, Hatha Yoga for Stress & Anxiety, Breathwork for Hormonal Balance.
 * If the running order ever changes again, this image changes with it — it is
 * the one asset on the page that spells the schedule out in pixels, and no
 * amount of copy nearby can correct it.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS ART STILL READS "₹497". The funnel is FREE now and every other
 * price point on the site says so, but the seal in this graphic does not.
 * Re-cut it (or swap the seal for "FREE") before this funnel goes live, or the
 * hero shows a paid price directly beside a free registration button.
 *
 * ratio matches the asset's own 2752x1536. It was 3 / 2 for the previous cut,
 * and leaving it there would have cropped about 8% off each side with
 * object-cover — enough to clip the wordmark on the left and the price seal on
 * the right. See the note on Art in shared.tsx.

                shots competing.

   Four figures on a ruled row, lifted so the card straddles the seam between
   the dark stage and the cream page — the join is a designed object rather
   than a colour change.

   The source copy sets these with emoji (❤️ ⭐ 🛡️ 💯). They are rendered as
   matched-weight line icons instead: emoji as UI is the single loudest
   template tell, and it renders differently on every device the audience owns.
   The words are untouched. */
