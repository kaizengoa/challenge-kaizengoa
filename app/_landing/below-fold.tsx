   by Prerna herself, there is no Yoga Nidra or EFT day, and the two Pilates

 * BODY at all — on a 375px viewport that is roughly thirteen screens of
 * testimonials, toolkit and founder story with no way to act on any of it
 * except the docked bar. The bonus stack is the page's first accumulation
 * peak, and it ended by handing the reader straight into a biography.
 *
 * So it lands immediately after the last bonus and immediately before MEET
 * YOUR GUIDE, which is exactly where the intent is highest. (Spec BLOCKER 3.)
 *
 * ONE CTA, deliberately. The instruction is explicit that no others are added,
 * and it is the right instruction: a page that repeats its button every two
 * screens reads as a page that does not trust its own argument.
 *
 * Styled as the hero button — the same gold fill, navy label, pill and
 * shimmer — rather than as the navy PrimaryCTA, so the two strongest moments
 * on the page look like the same object.
