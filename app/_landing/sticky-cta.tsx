/**
 * The docked CTA (page chrome, not a section).
 *
 * ══ VISIBLE FROM THE FIRST SCREEN ═════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * It used to stay hidden until the hero had scrolled off, then dock in with a
 * 0.78s brick animation on a further 0.35s delay. That is over a second of a
 * reader looking at a page whose primary action has not arrived yet, and on a
 * phone the hero is tall enough that plenty of people were scrolling through
 * the fold before the bar existed at all.
 *
 * So the pastHero gate is gone and the initial state is `true`: the bar is in
 * the first paint of the server HTML and needs no JavaScript to appear. There
 * is no entry animation and no transition on the way in.
 *
 * The one gate that REMAINS is `atFinal`. The closing recap carries a
 * full-width CTA of its own, and a docked bar duplicating a button the reader
 * can already see is two primaries, which is none. That is a hide, not a
 * reveal, so it costs nothing at load.
