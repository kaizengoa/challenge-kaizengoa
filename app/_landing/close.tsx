 * A founder's story has no inherent structure — no sequence, no contrast, no
 * set — and forcing one onto it (a fake timeline, three "pillar" cards cut out
 * of her paragraphs) is the design equivalent of inventing a claim. So this is
 * clean, well-set type on a capped measure, with ONE object in it: the
 * pull-quote, which is editorial scaffolding rather than a manufactured
 * structure.
 *
 * Photography of Prerna has not arrived yet, so the left column runs as three
 * reserved slots at the exact ratios the real shots will take: one portrait
 * lead with two squares beneath it. Nothing reflows when the images land.
 *
 * To go live, fill PHOTOS with paths. Any entry left null keeps its reserved
 * slot, so the section can also run with only the lead shot supplied.

              Prerna is the founder of Kaizen, a holistic wellness space in Goa
              that brings certified experts across Pilates, yoga, breathwork,
              sound healing, nutrition and recovery together. She holds an MBA
              from ISB Hyderabad and has built Kaizen around sustainable,
              inside-out wellness.

              Prerna saw women eating carefully, exercising regularly and still
              waking up exhausted, stiff and unlike themselves. As she began
              navigating the same phase and saw this pattern among Kaizen’s
              clients, one thing became clear: (peri)menopause affects the body,
              mind and sense of self. Exercise alone could never be the complete
              answer.

 *
 * The mechanism, and it reads as "the N principles of the method" rather than
 * "the old way vs the new way" — so it is a numbered ledger, not a comparison.
 * Hairline-ruled rows with big lit ordinals: a ledger reads audited and
 * accountable, which is what sells competence. It is deliberately NOT another
 * icon-card grid, because the Experience section three screens up already is
 * one.
 *
 * The v1 source numbered these 01, 02, 03, 04, 02, 05, a repeated "02" with no
 * "06", and that had to be corrected by hand. The revised copy ships them
 * numbered 01 to 06 correctly, so this ledger now follows the source exactly.

 *
 * The premium peak. The last thing the reader touches before paying, so it is
 * the most finished object on the page: a layered frame with a gold flourish
 * and ornament, a medallion seal, a hairline-ruled ledger with a value on
 * EVERY row (never one lump), and the value collapse dramatised — the ₹5,485
 * draws its own strike-through, then ₹497 pops in lit.
 *
 * It stays on the cream page. The brief is light-theme-only below the hero, so
 * the peak is earned with craft and depth rather than by turning the lights
 * off.
