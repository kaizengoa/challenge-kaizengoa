/**
 * Two faces, three voices.
 *
 * Fraunces (display) is a warm, high-contrast serif with a soft-square
 * skeleton: it sits beside the Kaizen script wordmark without competing with
 * it, and it carries authorship, which is what a founder-led wellness offer
 * needs. It never appears below headline size.
 *
 * Manrope (body) does the reading, at a 17px base — the audience is women 40 to
 * 55 and nothing on this page relies on a hairline weight.
 *
 * The third voice, the "spec" one that labels and credentials use, is tracked
 * uppercase Manrope rather than a monospace. That is a deliberate exception to
 * the house three-voice rule: a mono reads clinical against a hand-script logo
 * and a menopause-support offer, and tracked caps do the same job in the right
 * register. Noted in design-system.project.md.
 */
/* Both faces are VARIABLE-only on Google Fonts, so neither declaration passes a
   `weight` array: next/font rejects one for a variable family ("available
   weights: variable"). Omitting it loads the whole wght axis, which is what
   every font-semibold / font-bold on the page is already asking for, and it is
   one file per family rather than five. */

/* Named the four modalities the page used to run — "Pilates, yoga, mindfulness
   and breathwork" — one of which (mindfulness, as a standalone day) is not on
   the schedule, and omitted sleep, which is now Day 1 and the founder-led one.
   A search result that promises a day the challenge does not run is a refund
   request with a delay on it.

   Built from the offer tokens rather than typed, so the date, the timings and
   the price cannot drift from the page they describe. SESSION_TIMES_PROSE, not
   SESSION_TIMES: an ampersand in a meta description renders as markup in some
   SERP previews. (Spec PRIORITY 1.) */

/* The live origin. Without a metadataBase Next resolves every share URL and
   every relative OG asset against localhost, so a link pasted into WhatsApp
   previews as a dead local address.

   This is deliberately defensive, because metadataBase is evaluated at BUILD
   time on every route including the generated /_not-found. A bad value here
   does not degrade the page, it fails the deploy:

     `??` does NOT catch an empty string. A host that defines the variable with
     a blank value (Vercel does exactly this when the key is added without one)
     gives new URL('') and ERR_INVALID_URL, which is what broke the build.

   So: fall back on any falsy value rather than only on null, add the protocol
   if someone pastes a bare domain, and if it still will not parse, use the
   literal rather than throwing. */
